**WARNING: still in the process of incremental writing**

In this analogy, I hope to clarify the concept of [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) by using Minecraft as an analogy.

# Mining, blocks and items.
In this analogy, I am going to equate [Minecraft blocks](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Block) with information, [Minecraft items](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Item_(entity)) with knowledge, and [mining](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Breaking) with learning. Actually, for the purposes of the analogy, I count any means of acquiring items as mining, not only the narrow definition of braking blocks, so that activities such as getting loot from [chests](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chest), shearing [sheep](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Sheep) or reaping [farms](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Farming) I also consider "mining". Let me explain why I chose this mapping.

## Blocks are information
Blocks and items are related like information and knowledge are related. You need to expend effort to mine a block to get an item, just like you need to expend effort to understand information to arrive at knowledge. Without the effort, you get no value from the blocks, and you get no value from the information, so that just like blocks are largely useless on their own, not-understood information is largely useless on its own.
## Items are knowledge

## Building things is like solving problems
Knowledge can be thought of as a resource used to solve problems, and items can be thought of as a resource used to build things (e.g. houses or tools). So in this analogy, building things is equated with solving problems. Just like solving a problem is not possible unless you (or someone else) has the appropriate knowledge stored in memory, building some structure is not possible unless you (or someone else) has items stored in their inventory (incidentally, this equates "memory" with "inventory" in our analogy).

Items can have value, which is based on the goals that the player can achieve by using the item (e.g. build a tool, build a house, create a potion, etc.). This is analogous to knowledge, which also has value that is largely based on the goals it can help us achieve. For more on this, see: [Item Valuation Network](#the-item-valuation-network) below.

## Mining is learning
I hope the above two sections make it clearer why mining is like learning. When learning, we find information, try to understand it, and the result is knowledge. When mining, we find blocks, expend effort to break them, and the result is items.

# The mine drive
Let's call the [learn drive](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learn_drive) analogue in Minecraft the "mine drive". The mine drive is a system that exists in the brain of all players. It is activated when there is a need for more items. It guides the player's decision-making when exploring the Minecraft world in order to find valuable items. It tells the player in which directions to move and in which not to move. The guidance of the mine drive is based on the **subjective attractiveness** the player experiences towards certain actions and choices. When the mine drive computes that a certan action has a high probability of helping the player acquire valuable items, that action becomes appealing, and not undertaking it feel would feel unpleasant. Anything which gets in the way of the action is an annoyance. An action which the mine drive evaluates as not likely enough to help the acquisition of valuable items is experienced as unappealing. The takeaway is that undertaking those actions which seem appealing and ignoring those which seem unappealing will result in the acquisition of valuable items. Put simply, doing what the player feels like doing will result in good things, because that which feels good is that which the mine drive has evaluated is likely to result in good things.
## Simple example
Lets say you need [diamonds](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diamond), and while exploring the environment you notice the entrance to a [cave](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Cave). Lets say you have often seen diamonds in caves in the past, or in the past someone told you that caves have diamonds. When you see the cave, you are induced by the mine drive to go there, because of the high probability the drive assigns to your finding diamonds in the cave. The mine drive will generate a reward upon your noticing the cave, and the prospect of exploring it will seem very appealing to you. This appeal is how the mine drive guides you towards taking the action of exploring the cave.

Alternatively, if you don't know anything about caves, the mine drive may still guide you to go there, because novel environments are inherently rewarding to explore. The reward from exploring such environments is again generated by the mine drive, and this reward is necessary to induce you to explore them.

## Video example

In this example I will analyze [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AB74AszfIo).

At [8:16] the player sets the goal of finding a village, with the hope that this will result in the acquisition of bookshelves (or other items of value).

At [9:12] he makes the decision to go South, because he has not explored in that direction, so the probabiliy of finding a village in that direction is higher than finding one in directions already explored. However, he notices angry villagers on his path, which means he has a [Bad Omen](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bad_Omen). This event is important because it boosts his valuation of cows milk, as milk will achieve the goal of removing the omen. Notice that a new goal changes valuations. After taking care of the villagers, he resumes his village search.

At [12:30] he notices a cow. Because the player has placed high value on milk (due to the previously set "remove Bad Omen" goal), the action of going to the cow and taking its milk is appealing. The appeal of the action is how the mine drive guides the player to acquire the valuable item (milk). If there was no Bad Omen, he would have just ignored the cow. Maybe he wouldn't have even noticed it, its presence would have been subconsciously ignored. The players are not even aware of the many computations the mine drive is doing under the hood, all they know is that certain actions are appealing and others are not. Upon drinking the milk and removing the omen, the goal was achieved, the value of milk is reduced, and hence the player will not finding it appealing to expend the effort to milk any other cows encountered down the road (e.g. like in [16:42]). Again, they may even fail to register in his conscious attention, even if they are caught by his peripheral vision. However, once he fails to find a sufficient number of bookshelves in the villages he found, he decides to get leather from cows (leather is necessary for making books), which again boosts the cows' valuation and makes the actions of finding them appealing. Notice how during the course of the episode the player went from valuing cows (due to the Bad Omen), to not valuing them (once the Bad Omen was removed), to valuing them again (once he realized he needs leather). Valuations are very flexible.

At [13:39] the player gets the idea that finding a vantage point may make it easier to spot a village. That idea is internally generated by the mine drive, and the action of finding the vantage point is experienced as appealing by the player, which is why he executes it. Upon mounting a summit, he notices smoke particles, which signal the presence of a village. Notice the reward and excitement he experiences upon seeing the smoke -- "Oh, we have smoke particles over there! This is a village! Ah, cool! Hahaha!". That reward is important for the reinforcement of the actions taken which lead up to finding the village. In the future, those actons may seem even more appealing, and that appeal is how the mine drive will guide the player to again take them.

Finally, at [14:45] the player starts collecting items, and you can tell he finds the process very enjoyable (e.g. at [15:43] you can hear him "Ooh man, I love villages!"). The process of collecting the items is highly rewarding.

## Summary and takeaways
- the player experiences a need for certain items, and the need is based on the goals he has
- he knows that villages are a great place to collect such items, so he sets the goal of finding one
- the exploration process is guided by an internal system (the mine drive). That system guides the trajectory by making the player experience actions it wants him to take as appealing, and actions it doesn't want him to take as unappealing.
- guidance is influenced by past experience, so that the more the player relies on the mine drive the guidance system, the better the system becomes
- rewards are generated upon discovery of an item source (the village) and upon collecting the items
- rewards reinforce the decisions which lead to the acquisition of valuable items

## The mine drive and the learn drive
Just as the mine drive guides exploration in a Minecraft physical space, the learn drive guides exploration in an information space (e.g. a library, articles on the WWW, Youtube videos, a network of scientific papers, etc.). Just as the the mine drive guides actions which result in the acquisition of valuable items (as determined by the [item valuation network](#the-item-valuation-network)) by making good actions appealing and bad ones unappealing, the learn drive guides actions which result in the acquisition of valuable knowledge (as determined by the [knowledge valuation network](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_valuation_network)) by making good ones appealing and bad ones unappealing. Just as the mine drive generates a reward upon discovery of item sources (e.g. [villages](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Village), [caves](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Cave), [shipwrecks](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Shipwreck), etc.) and the actual collection of items, the learn drive generates a reward upon the discovery of information sources (books, articles, videos, podcasts, etc.) and the actual acquisition of knowledge from those sources. In both systems rewards reinforce the sequence of actions taken to arrive at the reward. So just like doing what you feel like doing when exploring for items will result in good things, doing what you feel like doing when learning will result in good things.

# The item valuation network
This is the analogue of the [knowledge valuation network](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Knowledge_valuation_network) in the brain. Items are deemed valuable by the item valuation network if they serve the goals of the player. For example, the player has the goal of surviving, so they value [armor](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Armor), [weapons](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Weapon) and [food](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Food). Diamonds are an item that can be used to build armor and tools, so diamonds are valued by the player, because they ultimately help the goal of staying alive. If the player has the goal of building some structure, then all items which help build that structure are valuable: [wood](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Wood), [stone](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Stone), whatever. Just as goals are in constant flux, so are valuations. The mine drive relies on the output of the item valuation network in order to determine what is worth exploring for.

The item valuation network is also at work when comparing the value of two items. For instance, when you have a full inventory but have a valuable block in front of you, the item valuation network makes the choice of what, if anything, to leave behind to mine the block and take its item. For example, if we go back to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5AB74AszfIo), you can see him making such choices at [20:16] (drops lantern to get books), [20:43] (drops iron ingots to get leather) and [20:48] (drops apples to get meat). Interestingly, the last example shows that it may be a bit hard to make the choice.

As with all choices, the player will just *feels* that it is a good idea to drop something in favor of something else, and they may be unaware of the computations made by the item valuation network in order to generate this feeling, all they know about is the feeling itself.

# Sleep

Perhaps surprisingly, I don't equate real-life sleep with [Minecraft sleep](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bed) in this analogy. Instead, I equate real-life sleep with an automatic process in Minecraft which, among other things, does this:
- organizes the player's [inventory](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Inventory) and [chests](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Chest) (which can be equated with long-term memory) so that items are easy to find, possibly putting labels on the chests for even faster lookup.
- throws away garbage items accumulated during the mining process (e.g. [dirt](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Dirt) collected when digging). The sleep process relies on [the item valuation network](#the-item-valuation-network) to decide which items are garbage and which are valuable and should therefore be kept.
