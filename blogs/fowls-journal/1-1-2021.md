# 1/1/2021

## Morning
Really did nothing. Still tired from having gone to sleep at 4.30 AM; however, it was worthy because I was reading a web novel.

## Afternoon
After an attempted nap, smashed a full pomodoro back to back. Did 160 squats, 20 push ups, 40-40 hip raises and crunches and wrote 604 words.
