# 10/1/2021	

Streaming on twitch.com/Fowl_SM lately. 

I'm still not sure about the format of this journal. If you have some feedback, feel free to leave a comment or just send me an email at jacopofowl@gmail.com
I'm starting to have doubts about doing pomodoros. The structure they give me is somewhat inflexible and does not represent my "process oriented" mindset well enough. Flexibility is lost with timers. 
I am a firm believer of pausing your work multiple times, and a timer can be incredibly useful for that. However, planning beforehand may be actually better.
I'm going to stop doing my pomodoros and employ personal heuristics more. 
The problem I have with pomodoros is that your mind stops wandering and you enter a focus zone. Wait, what? Isn't that the ideal state for everyone?
Nope. Not for me. It consumes an ungodly amount of mental resources. I feel emptied and compelled to go forward when doing so. Fol all I care about my university, job and writing, my mental health feels deteriorated because of this strict rules I've been imposing on myself.

I'll go back to a more fluid approach with my "pingback habits" system. What's that? I'll leave the template for it down below.
