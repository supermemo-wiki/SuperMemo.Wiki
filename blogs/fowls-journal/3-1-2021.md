## Daily objectives
The main problem in my schedule is represented by external interference and downtime.
That external interference with my schedule (e.g. family gathering) bothers me so much is probably a problem in my flexibility. The quick solution would be adjusting my daily activities in a way that they can be moved around without causing a major disruption. 
The immovable nature of my computer is also a problem when I start getting tired. Ideally some of the pomodoros on top should be doable whily lying down. 
Downtime after lunch clearly indicates that I should be eating way less at that our and probably adopt a protein+fat meal instead of mainly carbs (e.g. pasta). 
Feeling tired at night but not being able to sleep means that there is a two to four hours slot of maximum inefficiency at night. Solutions? Using a laptop to write or do reps has not worked that well in the past, but it's worth exploring that option again. Creating Anki cards on the phone or writing on the phone? Probably easier but high risk of me simply reading a book instead of doing that.
