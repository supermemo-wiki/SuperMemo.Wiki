## Comments

Learned some pretty neat technique from Naess. Gonna be using that a lot tomorrow. 
Not much exercise done. I've been smoking my mother's cigarettes a lot today; didn't help with motivation. 
Lunch at my father's place kinda killed my afternoon since I ate so much and got back around 16.

## Conclusions
- Smoking is not just bad for health, but actively discourages me from doing physical activity.
- Napping is fundamental but when people are playing cards and shouting at each other in your house it's not easy.
- I need to write more on this journal.
