# FAQ

### AGDF: When you study with neural review do you go over the majority of your classes "scripts" made by students(fun fact in Portugla we call it desgravadas)? Or don't you have time to go over most topics? And only go through those you find the few you feel that are most interconnected/important fundamental pieces?
 
##### Material
I mainly use the notes mady by students and outsorce some studying to the internet. I think that textbooks usually have too much detail and more often than not their organization is not ideal. If I could use Split Article on a textbook chapter, like I do on Wikipedia, I would reconsider, MAYBE. But still, the amount of stuff a med student is supposed to know is so large that I'd rather not waste time on things that are never going to be asked in detail or asked at all. 

##### Studying everything with Neural Review?
It's impossible unless your knoweledge tree has seen some huge time investment. 
I MAINLY use Neural Review when I feel like studying in a direction. If you only use Neural Review, you will lose yourself in a tunnel.
