# Parallel Learning and Concentrated Learning: In Light of a System That Doesn't Forget

## Introduction
In high-school we have mostly accepted the idea that material should be studied side by side, Geography and History, Physics and Chemistry, with the usual justification that the materials will "link" together, although that doesn't sound practical when you consider that you are learning both materials for the first time together, which won't allow a forming of connections before first understanding each one on their own.

Let's call the previous method "Parallel Learning" where we spread our time between a number of subjects to study them while trying to make sure that study is done before an exam, one of the many downfalls of such study method is that some material may be discarded as "less important" for an exam than other and of course the cramming that happens inevitably with so much material crammed into such a small space of time.

## SuperMemo and Incremental Reading
Although SuperMemo's incremental reading concept solves this problem by having the material spread in an efficient way and having no real deadlines on material in free learning, I still think and have personally faced a problem with parallel learning that makes it impractical and motivating in the long run, the lack of perceived progress.

## Concentrated Learning
Say you had 3 books, each 12 chapters long, and you can study a chapter from each book a week, finishing 1/12th of the material (3/36) in a week, with a very small amount of perceived progress, let's say we change that into studying 3 chapters from one of the books a week, the amount of actual progress is still (1/12th) but the perceived progress is much more, which leads to better motivation to study.

This approach would fail in a traditional school system, because you'd have one or two books done by the exam time, but in SuperMemo, this is no problem at all, as by the time you get to the third book, the first is already well absorbed into your knowledge, you don't forget it as is the case with high-school, and you get to see yourself progress more which motivates you to study, not to mention that it cancels the hassle of scheduling 3 or more different books a day or a week, and leaves you with less choices to make and more focus to put into your work.

## Final Word
On a final personal word I'd like to emphasis that this is the approach that I'll be adapting this method fully in 2021, as for the past 4 years I've been doing parallel learning either in my free learning or in school, I'll do a reflection on it if one is needed and update this blog, and a final reminded that this might work for me and some others, but not for you, we all learn in different ways and I'm merely presenting what is useful to me in the hopes that someone else will find it useful.
