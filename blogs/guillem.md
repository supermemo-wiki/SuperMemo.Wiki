## Bio
I am Guillem Palau from Barcelona, Spain. I did suffered a lot in the school system. I may say more than usual as I did nothing better than repeating 3 times the same high school year, followed by studyng multiple bachelor' and master's degress in college. Now I do learn purely following my learn drive, which luckily survived all years of coercion.
