# Learning as a remedy to depression
> Article will be incrementally written
{.is-warning}


Wikipedia definies [Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)) as the state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to **loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure** in certain activities that usually bring joy to people.

Quotes I will be using
> Toddlers seem to show the most exuberant learn drive. No wonder, healthy children are born optimistic. There is a correlation between optimism and the learn drive. Happy mind might act as an energizer of the learn drive on the neurochemical basis. Pessimism will definitely act as a suppressant or filter that will prevent the expression of the learn drive. In that sense, pessimistic mind may mask the learn drive

> A consensus seems to emerge that schools are a major contributor to depression among teenagers (and later in life). The mechanism isn't clear, but learned helplessness and the suppression of the learn drive emerge as possible keys to the pathology

> For memories to have a significant impact on mood, we need many of them. It is not enough to sit down a session with psychotherapist and learn a few key facts about the brain, our lives, or coping strategies. It takes months and years of learning to develop healthy tracks in the brain

>  Trauma can plant memories that will stoke up new source of activation that will override activation from other sources. In other words, an armament of good memories may count for nothing if a switch changes the tracks in use or if a new source of activation is born in the brain.

> For a depressed individual with no skills in the department, SuperMemo is no remedy. It is too late. Trying to master incremental reading in a bad state of mind could only make matters worse. It could result in a hate of incremental reading. 


> If learning is possible, it can act as a refuge, which might help suppress negative memories and build new connections. As of that point, the process of building new tendrils of knowledge may begin. This process that should take the mind towards a more optimistic interpretation of the world is slow and laborious.




## Environment shaping my personality 
Coerced schooling, bullying, selective mutism, 6 years going to the psychologist: from 8 to 14 years old.

No pharmacological intervention
  
  
## Trapped in time
 Part time prison, full time nightmare.
