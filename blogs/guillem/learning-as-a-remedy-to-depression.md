# Learning as a remedy to depression
> Article will be incrementally written
{.is-warning}

### Bulletpoints to develop
- Early stages
	- selective mutism
 	- own judgement
	- 6 years going to the psychologist, form 8 to 14 years old.
- During high school
	- the sentiment no one could understand my situation, which added frustration.
 	- "trapped in time"
 	- hikikomori period
 	- lost all faith in the system. Discovering free learning without realising it.

- At later stages of my life
	- depression from other events in life than school coercion.
