Wikipedia definies [Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)) as the state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to **loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure** in certain activities that usually bring joy to people.

## Trapped in time
 Part time prison, full time nightmare.
