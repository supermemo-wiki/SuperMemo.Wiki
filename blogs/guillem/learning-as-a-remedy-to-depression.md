{.is-warning}


Wikipedia definies [Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depression_(mood)) as the state of low mood and aversion to activity. It can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, motivation, feelings, and sense of well-being. The core symptom of depression is said to be anhedonia, which refers to **loss of interest or a loss of feeling of pleasure** in certain activities that usually bring joy to people.

Happy mind might act as an energizer of the learn drive on the neurochemical basis. Pessimism will definitely act as a suppressant or filter that will prevent the expression of the learn drive. In that sense, pessimistic mind may mask the learn drive

Coerced schooling, bullying, selective mutism, 6 years going to the psychologist: from 8 to 14 years old.

No pharmacological intervention
  
  
## Trapped in time
 Part time prison, full time nightmare.
