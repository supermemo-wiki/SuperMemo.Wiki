#Notes from Paul RR Voice chat event

## General

> Some notes are not shared to respect his privacy
{.is-info}


- He has 6.5 years of experience with SRS.
- He has a 27K+ card collection for just maths in mnemosyne.
- He uses SuperMemo for everthing else than maths.
- He considers himself a math master.
- He does not claim mastery in stoicism.
- He considers himself a begginer to Incremental Reading.
- He spends about 3 daily hours SRSing.
- He tried to introduce people to SRS unsuccesfully.
- **all your knowledge is always provisional**.
- Basic facts are worth keeping them, perhaps you could forget them in 20 years. Is preferable to do the opposite error: doing the card when is not needed. 
He started using SRS to distinguish art styles (paintings). Then he was able recognize the style on new paintings he saw. (prediction). 	


As of today, if he could chose when to start using SRS, that would be at 8 or 9 years old.

Book recommendation [make it stick](https://books.google.es/books/about/Make_It_Stick.html?id=oneWAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false) & [Feeling-Good](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Feeling-Good-New-Mood-Therapy/dp/0380810336)



## Stoicism

- Global vision: don't think about the non-pschological aspects
- When things go bad: start learning
- He mentioned [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius)
- We can achive stoichism faster with SRS
- He thinks to world is going good and better, current events are better than before.
- **Creating knowledge to solve world problems**
- Most psychological studies are not replicalable.
- Emotion is universal: facial expressions
- Making cards to remember some of his own thoughts 
- He makes cards manually as most of the source is his own life.
- [*Problem of induction*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_induction)

*It is possible to learn to philosophies that contradict/disagree each other?*
Yes, by specifying it in the formulation. You could say: acording to philosophy A, what is that?

## Mats

{.is-success}
- **Math is knowledge**
- Mathematicians narrow their knowledge due to forgetfulness.
- Maths are not suitable for Incremental Reading.
- He does not uses pen and paper while doing repetitions.
- *Perfect formulation*: some cards can be said that are optimized to perfection, as that can be proven with mathematically. Adding the proof method to formulating proof is optimum. Other item formuation will never achive perfect formulation in one's lifetime.
- He doesn't have very basic mathematical facts that anybody would know, such as a definition of a prime number.

## Education
- He would not have reached his current wisdom without SRS. 
- He supports [Taking kids seriously](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taking_Children_Seriously)
