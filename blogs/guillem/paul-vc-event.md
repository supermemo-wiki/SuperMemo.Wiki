# General
- He has 6.5 years of experience with SRS.
- He has a 27K+ card collection for just maths in mnemosyne.
- He considers himself a math master.
- He does not claim mastery in stoicism.
- He considers himself a begginer to Incremental Reading.
- He spends about 3 daily hours SRSing.
- (humans are much better generalitzation)
- **all your knowledge is always provisional**.
- Basic facts are worth keeping them, perhaps you could forget them in 20 years. Is preferable to do the opposite error: doing the card when is not needed. 
He started using SRS to distinguish art styles (paintings). Then he was able recognize the style on new paintings he saw. (prediction). 	


As of today, if he could chose when to start using SRS, that would be at 8 or 9 years old.

- He uses mnemosine for the shake as LaTeX
- He does not uses pen and paper while doing repetitions.
- **Math is knowledge**
- Perfect formulation: some cards can be said are optimized to perfection, as that can be proven with mathematically. Adding the proof method formulating proof.
- He doesn't have very basic mathematical facts that anybody would know, such as a definition of a prime number.

# Stoicism



Global vision: don't think about the non-pschological aspects
- When things go bad: start learning
- He mentioned [Marcus Aurelius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius)

- Creating knowledge to solve world problems
- Most pschological studies are not replicalable.
- Sad or dispair:you are still willing to act
- emotional is universal: facial expressions
- universal events: death of a loved one.
- Making cards to remember some own thoughts 
- He makes cards manually as most of the source is his own life.

Yes.
