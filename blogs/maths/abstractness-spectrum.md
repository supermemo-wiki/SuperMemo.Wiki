# The abstractness spectrum of procedural learning contexts?

**(I'm putting this out in its current unfinished state so I can work on it incrementally)**

In the spirit of learning with the garage door open, here's a post about a recent idea of mine that strolls dangerously close to the obvious

I've been thinking a lot about what the "Supermemo of procedural learning" should be like, and especially how the free learning and incremental aspects of it should work. These following observations from my day to day experience have helped me understand better what I'd want out of such a framework. But let's say it's all just a little heuristic that got me excited, but to which I'd give a rather low confidence score, for now. 

Lately I've started thinking of all the different approaches a person, in a self-directed learning process, can adopt to improve one's ability at a particular skill as something that could be categorized in a spectrum of how much the approach in question abstracts the desired skill.  

For instance, at one extreme of said spectrum, suppose I pick up a saxophone at this very moment —an instrument I've never so much as touched in my entire life — and use all my intellectual capacity to try to play a major scale. That would certainly be very unsuccessful, and if we were dealing with a skill of a different nature, trying to emulate it completely right out of the bat could be dangerous. But it's still an approach, nonetheless, and it's not an unfeasible one if we think of things like football juggling. Actually, I think that, for some skills, going at it naively with all you've got at first, with the right mindset, could be fantastic for getting your learn drive going. This is also something that seems to be very popular for progress videos, as I've seen many novice skateboarders on youtube reach a decent level after a long enough period of doing just this every day. 

At the other extreme of said spectrum, the skill becomes so abstracted it is essentially declarative learning. One example of this, which is also a pitfall that me and quite a few other Supermemo have fallen into, would be to incrementally read about an activity and make SRS flashcards out of it, without really spending enough time performing the skill in some form. I feel this approach is especially tempting when the declarative, background knowledge requirements around a skill are intimidating.

Here's a lousy visual representation of what I just said.

Very rarely we spend all our time learning something stuck at the same point in this spectrum. When this categorization first occurred to me, I realized the progression that happened in many of the different curricula I've followed at different points of my life could be thought of as different paths that go from one direction to the other in that graph. 

For example, when I was studying film in college, the introductory photography classes started with weeks and weeks of painfully boring powerpoint presentations. Then, after a while, we'd get to watch the professor operate the equipment, a few weeks later we'd get the chance to operate it ourselves under supervision, and so on. At the end of the semester we were required to do our own photo series about any topic we'd like, so we were more or less "free" at that point. I think of this kind of process as a straight line progression: we start at the "declarative learning" camp, and we gradually move towards "doing the real thing". 

Putting aside the very important discussion about the transmissionist models often employed in such contexts, the impression I have is that this is a very "traditional" way of approaching learning; old-fashioned, even. Though I confess that if I were to learn something like flying a plane, I think I'd probably want to follow a path like that. ^[I wonder if teachers that prefer traditional curricula generally think of students learning by themselves as something dangerous. I see this notion pop up in so many areas: "you have to learn it right the first time, or else you'll become full of bad habits you won't be able to fix"]

Alternatively, the film directing classes I had were very different. The first day in that class was actually a rather jarring experience. The professor started it by listing a set of very difficult requirements we would have to meet in our film assignment. And then, just when we'd start to think he would give us a deadline that'd be maybe a month away, he'd say: "you have two hours". The films we ended up making in a frenzy were predictably not very good, but those moments definitely had us working at the full extent or our mental capacities. The next week we'd go "back to the drawing board", discuss what went wrong in our creations and watch a lecture that would maybe show us different formalized techniques or examples of how to improve what we were doing. The requirements for the next assignment would then be tweaked to increase the difficulty (oftentimes in a way that emphasized what we discussed in class). Rinse and repeat. 

This experience I just described is something that I think of as a zigzag path through the spectrum of possible approaches. We start closer to the left side (if we use the earlier graph as reference) and go back and forth between that point and a point closer to the declarative learning side.

### Enough of curricula! What about self-directed learning?
