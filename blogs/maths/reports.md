# Introduction
I'm terrible at naming things, I'm terrible at defining the scope of my projects and at defining how I should present them; therefore, these are the things I normally tend to put off, otherwise I wouldn't get anything done. If you are reading this, this blog and the writings contained within it probably give a very unfinished and disorganized feel. This is supposed to be temporary, so please bear with me.   

What you're reading is the start of my attempt at writing, among other things, something vaguely similar to what Michal Wojcik did in his [Norsk Experiment](https://www.apronus.com/norsk/reports/reports.htm). But, in my case, instead of testing a new way of learning a language, I'm trying achieve far reaching changes in the way I approach learning things that have a significant portion that isn't declarative, and thus unfit for Incremental Reading and spaced repetition.

Supermemo and IR turned the way I approached declarative learning on its head. After encountering it, every other method suddenly felt like it was missing some crucial component. A lot of the advice I once followed now felt like misconceptions on how effective learning really happens.

However, declarative learning (which is the thing that SM is best for) makes up only for a rather small portion of the learning that has to happen for me to achieve the kind of goals that I have, for me to really follow my passions. The things that have the most applicability for what I want to accomplish are generally regarded as things you "learn by doing", and I'm really not satisfied in continuing tackling this problem by following such an indistinct notion. I want to find something akin to IR. 

"Deliberate Practice" is something which I also feel does not address all the problems I'm facing, maybe discussing my feelings towards it can be a good starting point for this series of reports on the progress of learning journey. I'm thinking of making it my next post.
