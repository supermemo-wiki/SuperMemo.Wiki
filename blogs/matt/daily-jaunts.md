# 1/4/21
The month is already off to a great start! 

##### Project Work
As expected, I fell in love with Balsamiq/wireframing and spent ~10 hours working on ideas for the app yesterday. I'm still up in the air over whether I want to (a) design a companion app, or (b) abstract out the major concepts and create something unique. I'm learning towards the latter, but I suspect I'll gain clarity as I continue creating the user flow in Balsamiq.

The C# courses are going very well. I'm 50% of the way through the Intermediate Course and loving it. I project that I'm going to have both the Intermediate and Advanced Courses finished by the middle of the month, which will leave a nice 2-week window to start the Xamarin course. I doubt that I will have it finished by the end of the month, but I foresee making solid progress on it. With any luck, I'll have the user flow in Balsamiq finished right around the time I finish the Xamarin course, and then I can start working directly on app development.

The current wave of motivation is excellent. Need to keep a close eye on it and manage appropriately.

##### On the health front...

Making excellent progress! My suspicion was correct regarding the row variant messing with my thoracic spine. Since switching to a new variant, the pain has decreased ~80% and appears to be getting better every day. About time I listened to my body rather than sticking dogmatically to a belief.

I was also correct that I needed to switch out overhead movements with a single-arm variant. However, using bands still caused some amount of discomfort, so I will use a combination of dumbbells and barbells for now.

It's far too early to see any gains on the hypertrophy front, but the workouts are feeling great and I'm highly motivated to do them every day. So...win, win and win.

##### SM & Learning
I've been highly intrigued with the "explicit connections" approach discussed by @strategypattern and @Naess. My own learning process has evolved in that direction over time as well, and it feels like the next logical step to take. Anecdotally, my SM time has been incredibly enjoyable recently as a result. Going through items is a real joy, and I'm making far more connections than I have in the past. 

We shall see how that ^ pans out, but I'm quite optimistic.
