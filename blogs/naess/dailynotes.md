# Applicability of knowledge
I just watched a video for stretching lower back, did the exercise and I feel AMAZING. This made me think about a piece from the incremental learning manual: *"An item related to a Heimlich maneuver can save the life of a family member"*. 

In our community, we often emphasize that the applicability of knowledge must be the top criteria in selecting material for consumption, but this experience once again highlighted the importance of it for me. I can read a whole book about elementary physics and not know much more about the world than I already did from my daily observations (e.g. how trees behave when there is wind). On the other hand, I can watch a 2 minute video about stretching and improve my life INSTANTLY and be able to do so in the future too. 

> For example, a sentence written in French "SuperMemo vous aide a mÃ©moriser et apprendre diverses informations comme une langue, des chiffres, etc." may be of nearly zero value for someone who does not know French. At the same time, an item related to a Heimlich maneuver can save the life of a family member. We know that the expected payoff equals the value of the payoff multiplied by its probability. Therefore, the low probability of a family member choking and the probability of actual successful application of the maneuver make the value of "Heimlich item" a fraction of the value of the human life. At the same time, even minor errors in medical knowledge of a physician can actually cost somebody's life and carry substantial negative value!
