# Child learning to play
What has been the most dominant change in my way of thinking in the past year, must be how I perceive uncertainty. There is few big ideas which shaped up my thinking for good. 

The first idea that made me even acknowledge the importance of handling uncertainty in our lives is from Piotr Wozniak, which is [Missile metaphor](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Missile_metaphor). It is about adaptability and goes like this:

> Imagine a perfectly adaptable low flying missile that can learn to navigate terrain obstacles in search of a target. Like the human brain adapts to the environment, the missile adapts to the navigation in a difficult terrain. With each hour of flight, the missile will become more and more efficient in tackling unpredictable situations. However, if we try to control the missile manually, as it happens to brains at school, the adaptation may lead to poor control. Let's imagine the missile flying into a long dark tunnel. Very soon, the missile will master the art of staying on course. In the tunnel, there is no complex control, and no advanced navigation necessary. After many years in the tunnel, when we release the missile back to the freedom of complex terrain, it will likely crash for it will have lost its navigation capacity through years of disuse. At school we do get some knowledge that may assist the learn drive in the process of recovery. However, this knowledge is comparable to taking on board a load of navigation manuals. After leaving the tunnel, the missile needs to navigate. Reading manuals with comprehension may come too late. Intelligent navigation requires fluency in making choices. That fluency does not directly come from textbook knowledge, and requires hours or years of practice.

This metaphor had very big impact on me and I can't pinpoint exactly why. Maybe the timing was just great as I had read a bit about economics of uncertainty and struck with a quote from a book called **The Charisma Myth**: 
> The ability to be comfortable with uncertainty and ambiguity turns out to be one of the strongest predictors of success in business.

Anyways, the ball about uncertainty started rolling and I became very intrigued about the whole thing. It made sense on so many levels in my life.  Back then I also found [Learning to navigate uncertainty and complexity](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Learning_to_navigate_uncertainty_and_complexity) which further reinforced the idea.

Some time passed and I started digging through a concept called "exploration" in my collection, which consists of tons of links and topics I am not familiar with. All of these have 100% priority and I explore the concept from time to time. Anyways, then I came across this very powerful idea...

## Cynefin Framework
Cynefin Framework, sometimes called "sense-making device" is a framework used to aid decision-making. It has five domains: obvious, complicated, complex, chaotic, and disorder. It helps managers to identify how they perceive situations and make sense of their own and other people's behaviour.[

Now the framework itself didn't mean much to me (though it seemed interesting!). What had very powerful impact on me was this neat illustration by Edwin Stoop:

I cropped the image but you can view the original [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Cynefin_framework_by_Edwin_Stoop.jpg/1920px-Cynefin_framework_by_Edwin_Stoop.jpg).

What was very powerful in this image was "**the art of learning how to play**". This had HUGE implications for me! Child who never kicked a football approaches it, kicks it, gets feedback and adjusts! He observes and adapts! For some reason this idea was very impactful to me, it just aligned so well with everything I knew. Also "The path will be created with every step" is so good.

# Applicability of knowledge

I just watched a video for stretching lower back, did the exercise and I feel AMAZING. This made me think about a piece from the incremental learning manual: *"An item related to a Heimlich maneuver can save the life of a family member"*. 

In our community, we often emphasize that the applicability of knowledge must be the top criteria in selecting material for consumption, but this experience once again highlighted the importance of it for me. I can read a whole book about elementary physics and not know much more about the world than I already did from my daily observations (e.g. how trees behave when there is wind). On the other hand, I can watch a 2 minute video about stretching and improve my life INSTANTLY and be able to do so in the future too. 

> For example, a sentence written in French "SuperMemo vous aide a mÃ©moriser et apprendre diverses informations comme une langue, des chiffres, etc." may be of nearly zero value for someone who does not know French. At the same time, an item related to a Heimlich maneuver can save the life of a family member. We know that the expected payoff equals the value of the payoff multiplied by its probability. Therefore, the low probability of a family member choking and the probability of actual successful application of the maneuver make the value of "Heimlich item" a fraction of the value of the human life. At the same time, even minor errors in medical knowledge of a physician can actually cost somebody's life and carry substantial negative value!

Btw, here is the link for the stretch exercise for those interested :)
