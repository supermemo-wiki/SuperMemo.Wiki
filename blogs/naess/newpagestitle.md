# Future of SM

In this page I will update features that I think would offer the biggest increase in learning productivity in SM. This list is not fixed and will be updated from time to time.

# Incremental Web Browsing

Import function in SM is old news and extra friction for curious mind. The importing part can be sped up with external tools, however there is still problem of jumping around hyperlinks, formatting and increasing amount of interactive tools in web which SM can not handle. In other words, it will always be more flexible to read in browser than in SM.

I made a simple AHK script which allows me to extract things from any website and leaving a highlight on the site, which will remain there even if you shut down your computer (the highlights are saved locally). 

This is done with simple copy paste function and chrome extension called highlighter https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/highlighter/fdfcjfoifbjplmificlkdfneafllkgmn

github for the highlighter: https://github.com/jeromepl/highlighter
