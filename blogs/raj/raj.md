# Raj's Corner

[SuperMemo in Context](/en/blogs/raj/smic)

Thing I've been thinking about:

**Title: How do you represent knowledge effectively? **

Date: Jan 16, 2021, Sat, 09:14

Note: work in progress, I haven't spent that much practically using these ideas to be able to say that these are optimal approaches. I'm 80% certain they're on the right track though. 

 

From my current understanding, there are 4 main aspects of knowledge representation that I can see. 

The first one is how you represent the concept. The other three are various axises of connections.

If we have a point in 3d space like above, the smaller and more refined the concept the easier it is to connect it to other points (minimum-information, maximum-connectivity). It becomes harder to make it 'fit' with other concepts the bigger or messier it gets.

Looking at the vertical y axis, I think that represents depth. The farther down you go, the more the depth of the knowledge. 

The horizontal x axis can be seen as lateral connections to other ideas. 

The depth z axis is connections to application. The idea is that as the y/x get deeper, z should increase by itself but in some cases, making direct connections there can be easier. It sort of relates to the idea that Woz talks about somewhere: is it more effective to memorize the derivation of a problem or to just memorize the answer?

 

For a concrete example of the above (from here): 

Most people (esp. affluent ones) are way too afraid of risking their social position through social disapproval. You can succeed where others fail just by being braver even if you're not any smarter. 


Refined concept: 

people are scared to take risks that could cause social disapproval and damage their social position -> people avoid risks risking social status 
if you ignore risk of social disapproval, you can take opportunities others won't -> ignoring social status games opens opportunities others overlook
Horizontal Connection: In free markets, winning requires doing things other people aren't. Not caring about social status allows you to try unique things that could have a higher chance of winning. 

Vertical: In evo-psych sense, people want to avoid sticking out and ostricization. That tendency often leads to groupthink and lack of new ventures that might not be all that bad but go against norms enough to feel risky. 

Depth: If an opportunity seems appealing to me but I'm thinking of not trying it because I risk social status for it, decide based on first principles (rather than fear or wanting to conform) if it's worth trying or not. Don't FOMO in or out. 

I'm not yet sure how you process the connections effectively but compare to just learning the refined concept, having the 'depth' connection feels like it makes the concept more likely to be applicable in real life.
