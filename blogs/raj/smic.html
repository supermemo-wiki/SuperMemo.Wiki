<p>Split: 40/30 (real work/learn)</p>
<p>Really like refactoring UI, gonna take me a while to understand it proper. In my SMiC collection, I have some non-design stuff at low priority (all tied to specific goals) but since I don't have that much on design those are coming up more than they should. I'm gonna import some more design things tomorrow and that should change.</p>
<p>The design work is fun but I think I probably need to do more replicating other people's designs to make things that are aesthetically pleasing. I'm not really sure how to split time on that yet since I do need to work on some actual designs for a project. Schedule is a bit of a mess tomorrow so probably will only get an hour or two in total but next week I want to be doing at least 3 hours of design a day or even more if possible.</p>
<p>One issue I'm having is that I'm not really sure what to do with a lot of what I'm reading. I'd want to learn it to apply it and I can read and understand and make cards but is that enough? Or should I read them, try them, then afterwards, after the ideas are really mine, make cards then? I don't know yet but I'll experiment.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ended up not using much of the morning as well as I could have because I unintentionally got up at 5:30 am and while&nbsp;I did a bit of IR in the morning, I got caught up in discord and other things and didn't end up doing any design stuff.</p>
<p>I did do a bit of learning just now in my SMiC collection which I found helpful. Will write more tomorrow since browser will be blocked soon</p>
