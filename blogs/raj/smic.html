<p><strong>Date: Jan 28, 2021, Thu, 22:38</strong><br><strong>Pleasing Work on The Design &amp; Learning Fun</strong></p>
<p>Split: 40/30 (real work/learn)</p>
<p>Really like refactoring UI, gonna take me a while to understand it proper. In my SMiC collection, I have some non-design stuff at low priority (all tied to specific goals) but since I don't have that much on design those are coming up more than they should. I'm gonna import some more design things tomorrow and that should change.</p>
<p>The design work is fun but I think I probably need to do more replicating other people's designs to make things that are aesthetically pleasing. I'm not really sure how to split time on that yet since I do need to work on some actual designs for a project. Schedule is a bit of a mess tomorrow so probably will only get an hour or two in total but next week I want to be doing at least 3 hours of design a day or even more if possible.</p>
<p>One issue I'm having is that I'm not really sure what to do with a lot of what I'm reading. I'd want to learn it to apply it and I can read and understand and make cards but is that enough? Or should I read them, try them, then afterwards, after the ideas are really mine, make cards then? I don't know yet but I'll experiment.</p>
<p>Input:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-SMiC Collection</p>
<p>Output:</p>
<p>-worked on a design for an app (is secret so won't show it yet)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ended up not using much of the morning as well as I could have because I unintentionally got up at 5:30 am and while&nbsp;I did a bit of IR in the morning, I got caught up in discord and other things and didn't end up doing any design stuff.</p>
<p>I did do a bit of learning just now in my SMiC collection which I found helpful. Will write more tomorrow since browser will be blocked soon</p>

<p>Day 1: Date: Jan 26, 2021, Tue, 22:15,&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Starting Fun and Realization that I am a Noob</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To start, I planned to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-go through Adobe XD tutorials</p>
<p>-IR refactoring UI</p>
<p>It ended up being that <i>using&nbsp;</i>XD&nbsp;was much easier than I expected and afer around an hour I&nbsp;think I was able to do probably 60% of fancy things. I messed around a lot and made a basic design for&nbsp;an idea I've had in mind for a while that combines sloppy note taking with quick thread/tasklist sorting.</p>
<p>When I tried that I realized: this is fun but also hard. I could tell that the design I made wasn't actually that good. It was usable, but it just didn't look&nbsp;fancy and proper enough. I am definitely a noob and it will take a while for me to not suck, though it's at least better than me throwing random ideas at people and hoping they'll get the execution according to my vision.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;started doing my&nbsp;new collection which was intended for design and other things I want to learn&nbsp;in a&nbsp;context. I began going through refactoring UI which looks promising. I probably should've read more of it but I ended up just extracting two chapters, looking for more stuff to import and then procrastinating.&nbsp;I was pretty tired or I'd have gotten more done&nbsp;I think.</p>
<p>Overall:</p>
<p>Input Time:</p>
<p>-messed around with Adobe XD tutorials</p>
<p>-did a bit of IR on&nbsp;SMiC collection/imported a new thing or two (looking for recs on UI/UX if you have&nbsp;em comment)</p>
<p>Output Time:</p>
<p>-worked a bit on design for thread rambler, will need to put more thinking into it<br>&nbsp;</p>
