# Urgency-Importance Matrix for SuperMemo Tasklist
> E.T. Jaynes says that reasoning must use all available evidence. By analogy, to get what you want, you should use all available tools. ~ [Mark Xu](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/d922gAtBM8JNzkKKJ/p/yxGBzrGMg4t8QNThA)

Urgency-Importance Matrices, or Eisenhower Matrices, are well known tools for organising tasklists. They are incredibly powerful.

In SuperMemo, we can replicate this by making four different tasklists for each of the quadrants. I've found this has boosted the quality of my tasklist usage DRAMATICALLY and am never going back.

For additional simplicity, I have also started only using a 1-5 rankng for the values of tasks, making giving tasks a value far simpler than before.
