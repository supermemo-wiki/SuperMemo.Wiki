# Chinese Community

The largest SM Chinese communities are using a software called [QQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tencent_QQ).

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**
> - QQ has a very **poor privacy policy**. We strongly discourage users to run QQ on computers with sensitive data.
> - QQ requires a working phone number to register an account.
> 
> You might be unable to register without a Chinese number.
