# 33rd Anniversary

This event took place on the 2020/12/13 on the occasion of SuperMemo's 33rd anniversary.

Users joined on a voice chat to converse and engage in various activities throughout the days. This event took place on the SuperMemo.wiki [Discord server](https://discord.gg/vUQhqCT).

A surprise visit was organized by [Piotr Wozniak](/supermemo/piotr-wozniak) and [Krzysztof Biedalak](/supermemo/krzysztof-biedalak), the two co-founder of [SuperMemo World](https://super-memory.com/english/company/smworld.htm).

Piotr Wozniak wrote [an article](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/33rd_anniversary_of_SuperMemo) where he explored in-depth the variety of topics discussed during the 3 hours long call he had with the few dozen users present at the time of his visit.
