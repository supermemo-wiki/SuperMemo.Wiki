## Participate

- ðŸš§&nbsp; The date of the event will be collectively decided through choosing the most convenient date for all participants.
- ðŸš§&nbsp; The theme of the plugin will be decided by the group through voting.

## Organization

This event is organized by [Alexis Incogito](https://github.com/alexis-), creator of [SuperMemo Assistant](https://sma.supermemo.wiki). I will supervize the entire duration of the hackathon to help participants setup their project and solve blocking issues.

## Prerequisites

Participants should be familiar with the following technologies:

- [SuperMemo 18](/supermemo)
- [SuperMemo Assistant](https://sma.supermemo.wiki)
- Decent level in C# programming
- (Optional) [Plugin writing](https://dev.supermemo.wiki/)

> This event is _not meant to learn programming from scratch_.
> 
> However, if you wish to participate, you can pick up the essential programming skills by dedicating some time to learning C# prior to the event (see below).

## Preparing for the event

While it isn't required to be familiar with SMA plugin writing, it is strongly encouraged. Similarly, decent fluency with the C# programming language is recommended.

Any preparation you make in those two aspects will make the event more enjoyable for you.
