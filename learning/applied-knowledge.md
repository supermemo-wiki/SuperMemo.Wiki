# Applying knowledge

Fields like Cog. Sci  are highly interdisciplinary. Not being zoomed into a single microcosm allows you to learn more freely, and therefore these fields are better career choices for supermemo users. Because these fields utilise a range of knowledge, it is much easier for you to bridge between the field in which you were trained to something that currently captivates you if you are qualified in one of these areas. 

To find decent textbooks, look at Quora and other various social media sites and find people looking for best textbooks for X. To find good textbooks for obscure topics like sleep, you can also just take sections from larger textbooks such as Cog. Sci ones. Take Piotrs stuff with a grain of salt as he is sometimes wrong, and the research he uses can be found to be outdated. Research can be given the green light by journalists, peer reviewers and subject experts but still be wrong. Matthiew walkers stuff is still good, but because sleep is such a rapidly changing field a few minor details are now invalid. 

Be curious about the things around you and you will never run out of applicable knowledge. With the right mindset, applicability is endless. Intergrating knowledge into your daily life makes it much more meaningful to you, and the innate drive to improve yourself could be useful for learning. An example of these two things in action would be measuring changes you make to your sleep and comparing your performance and alertness to the change you made, going up or down in increments. If you are young, contacting researchers can get you very far as they will be extremely willing to help someone with an early interest. Science is also applicable in any interaction with real life. Subjects like maths and philosophy are the most applicable, as they are applied to the act of thought itself and you are always thinking. Finding projects where you can apply your knowledge can make aquiring the knowledge much more enjoyable, and applicable.
