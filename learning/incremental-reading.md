# What is incremental reading?

Incremental reading is an incredibly enjoyable way of learning from thousands of sources in parallel. It was created by [Piotr Wozniak](/en/supermemo/piotr-wozniak).

Aside from the more advanced algorithm, incremental reading is the main feature that distinguishes [SuperMemo](/en/supermemo) from other spaced repition applications.


# What are the benefits of incremental reading?


-  Actually remember what you read (so you can apply it in real life!)
  
-  Simplicity in converting passive material into long-term active recall through quick cloze deletions
  
- Gradual convertion of knowledge with low up-front costs
  
- Peace of mind knowing you can import anything you wish to learn about and know it will come to you eventually
  
- It's fun!


# What do you actually do in IR?

After you have imported an article, it will eventually be shown to you again. You read the article and highlight and extract `(alt + x)` the bits you find important. 

Those extracts will then be shown to you later, and you are able to repeat the process, only extracting the most important material from the extract.

Incrementally you will painlessly be boiled down to information-dense sentences, of which you can select the key information you wish to remember and make a cloze deletion `(alt + z)`.

Your incremental reading will involve a pleasant mix of articles (topics), extracts, and question-and-answers to learn from.



## What if I import more than I can get through?

SuperMemo allows you to set priorities for every element, postponing the lesser-important material for as long as it needs to be delayed for. This way you can always be sure you are learning the most important material.


# How can I personalise my IR? 

- You can edit the proportion of topics vs items that you see. This contributes greatly to the enjoyment.

- Take care to quickly dismiss sources that are unpleasureable to learn from
