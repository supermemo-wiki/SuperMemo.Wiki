# Incremental Writing

**Incremental Writing (IW)** is a method for boosting creativity, quality and pleasure of writing. It synergizes with the natural ability of your brain to update knowledge and organize it into concept networks.

## How does it work ?

IW is typically assisted by software to maximize the usage of your time by interspacing:

- Reviewing new learning material to develop new insights, 
- Reviewing previously acquired knowledge to preserve it over time (forever !), 
- Creative work (writing, problem solving, ...).

In IW, the decision of whether you should continue working on a particular text depends on your desire to do so. That desire is a compound of variables: [pleasure of writing](/reference-manual/pleasure-of-learning), state of flow, level of understanding of the topic, etc.

## Benefits

A typical incremental writer:

- Never gets bored (there are always new and varied ideas to keep things exciting), 
- Increases his creativity (new information is constantly flowing), 
- Writes more efficiently (by progressing on several sections in parallel), 
- Is less prone to error (dividing in smaller sections makes it easier to spot mistakes, and update erroneous or outdated information with new understandings).
