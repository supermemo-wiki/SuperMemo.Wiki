**Spaced repetition (SR)** is a method for organizing your learning calendar in the most optimized way possible. It has two functions:
1. Knowledge learned this way should be remembered forever,
2. Remembering forever should use up the minimum amount of time possible.

# How does it work?

In practice SR is performed by creating **flashcards** and assigning them a [forgetting index](/supermemo/spaced-reptition#flashcards) within a computer software.

**Flashcard** is generic term for any association of knowledge. An example is the association between two words in different languages: "Hello" means "Bonjour" in French. The reciprocal association "Bonjour" -> "Hello" is another flashcard. They can be physical (paper cards) or virtual (like in SuperMemo).

The **forgetting index** is a number that represents the likelihood (e.g. 10%) you will forget a given piece of knowledge (e.g. "Hello" -> "Bonjour") before the next date on the calendar when SR has scheduled a **review** for it. For example, if on the 1st of January you learned that "Hello" means "Bonjour" in French, you might only be able to recall that with 90% certainty until the 20th of January. Past that date, the likelihood of recalling it will keep decreasing. This is because forgetting is exponential in nature:

Forgetting is avoided by **reviewing** your knowledge. Reviewing is the process of refreshing knowledge to ensure that it is persisted in memory. For example, on the 20th of January, you might quiz yourself:
> *What is the French translation for 'Hello'?*.

If you recalled correctly, then your memory of that knowledge will be persisted for an even longer time than you previously had, for example until March 31th with a 90% recall rate.
