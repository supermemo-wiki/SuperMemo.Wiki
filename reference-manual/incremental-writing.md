# Incremental Writing

**Incremental Writing (IW)** is a method for boosting creativity, quality and pleasure of writing. It synergizes with the natural ability of your brain to update knowledge and organize it into concept networks.

IW is typically assisted by software to maximize the usage of your time by interspacing:

- Reviewing new learning material to develop new insights, 
- Reviewing previously acquired knowledge to preserve it over time (forever !), 
- Creative work (writing, problem solving, ...).

Typically, using IW you:

- Never get bored (there are always new and varied ideas to keep things exciting), 
- Increase your creativity (new information is constantly flowing), 
- Write more efficiently (by progressing on several sections in parallel), 
- Are less prone to error (dividing in smaller sections makes it easier to spot mistakes, and update erroneous or outdated information with new understandings).
- In IW, the decision of whether you should continue working on a particular text depends on your desire to do so. That desire is a compound of variables: pleasure of writing, state of flow, level of understanding of the topic, etc.
