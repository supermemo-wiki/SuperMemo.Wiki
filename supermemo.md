# What is SuperMemo ?

[**SuperMemo**](https://super-memo.com/supermemo18.html){target="_blank"} is a program that **makes learning easy and fun**.

SuperMemo is built on two novel learning techniques named [Spaced Repetition](/learning/spaced-repetition) and [Incremental Reading](/learning/incremental-reading), pioneered by Dr. [Piotr Wozniak](/supermemo/piotr-wozniak)[^1] the inventor of SuperMemo. They enable users to form long-lasting memories, and to gain new knowledge more efficiently compared with Traditional techniques.

While the success of SuperMemo is often attributed to its cutting-edge  algorithms and techniques, Dr. Piotr Wozniak and many <abbr title="Users who have been using SuperMemo for a duration ranging from a few years, up to several decades.">long-time users</abbr> of SuperMemo[^2] emphasize the central importance of [Pleasure of Learning](/learning/pleasure-of-learning) in all forms of learning activities.
