# What is SuperMemo ?

[**SuperMemo**](https://super-memo.com/supermemo18.html){target="_blank"} is a program that **makes learning easy and fun**.

SuperMemo is built on two novel learning techniques named [Spaced Repetition](/learning/spaced-repetition) and [Incremental Reading](/learning/incremental-reading), pioneered by Dr. [Piotr Wozniak](/supermemo/piotr-wozniak)[^1] the inventor of SuperMemo. They enable users to form long-lasting memories, and to gain new knowledge more efficiently compared with Traditional techniques.

While the success of SuperMemo is often attributed to its cutting-edge  algorithms and techniques, Dr. Piotr Wozniak and many <abbr title="Users who have been using SuperMemo for a duration ranging from a few years, up to several decades.">long-time users</abbr> of SuperMemo[^2] emphasize the central importance of [Pleasure of Learning](/learning/pleasure-of-learning) in all forms of learning activities.

## Why can SuperMemo change your life ?

Here are a few reasons why SuperMemo might **improve your life**:

### Tabs{.tabset}
#### I am Human

1. **You can learn to love learning (again):**
    - Learning is the best way to improve your life,
    - SuperMemo is built to make learning pleasurable,
    - As you progressively learn to love learning, your life will gradually improve!
2. **You can meet amazing people:**
    - [Our community](https://discord.gg/vUQhqCT) is oustandingly supportive and caring,
    - You will have discussions on topics that you cannot have elsewhere,
    - These discussions will spark new ideas and projects.

#### I am a Student (TODO)

TO DO !

#### I am Salaried[^3] (TODO)

TO DO !

#### I am a Policy Maker

1. **You can learn to better handle complexity**
    - Understanding politics and societies demands a lot of knowledge,
    - SuperMemo is built to handle large volume of information,
    - You will become more informed, and better equipped to make good decisions.
2. **You can spread the word**
    - Once you rediscover the pleasure of learning, you will be able to promote policies that encourage it,
    - People will become more educated, and more happy.

**Incremental Reading (IR)** is a technique for organizing learning in a way that privileges *variety of studying material*. By contrast, traditional reading involves a linear process of reading a single topic extended periods of time.

In the context of this wiki, **material** designates any sort of media through which learning can be achieved. Some example of material include: books, web articles, videos, podcasts, etc.

### Comparison Matrix

The table below **compares the principles** of incremental reading (parallel) and traditional reading (linear), based on their "*average*" implementation. This is not representative of all the variations in which both of these methods can be executed.

### General flow of Incremental Reading (simplified)

In Incremental Reading, all the material yet to be processed is added to the **Outstanding queue**. 

```mermaid

graph TB
    IR-step1>"Read article"]
    IR-step2("<img src='/supermemo/incremental-reading/ir-1st-rep-step-1.png'; width='250px' height='154px'/>")
    IR-step3("<img src='/supermemo/incremental-reading/ir-1st-rep-step-2.png'; width='250px' height='161px'/>")
    IR-step4>"Move to next article"]
    
    IR-step1 -- 1. Locate interesting information --> IR-step2
    IR-step2 -- 2. Extract valuable text for later --> IR-step3
    IR-step3 -- 3. Repeat until bored with current article --> IR-step1
    IR-step3 -- 4. When bored with current article --> IR-step4
    IR-step4 -- 5. Repeat until done with studying --> IR-step1

```

### Example: Evolution over a few days

This example describes the **evolution of a paragraph** taken from a [larger article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning#Non-associative_learning) about *Learning*.

The numbers assigned to each day are only meant as illustrations for the purpose of our example. Actual intervals between repetitions will typically be larger in SuperMemo.

#### Day 1 of Incremental Reading
