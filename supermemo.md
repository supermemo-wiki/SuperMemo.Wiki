# What is SuperMemo ?

[**SuperMemo**](https://super-memo.com/supermemo18.html){target="_blank"} is a program that **makes learning easy and fun**.

SuperMemo is built on two novel learning techniques: [Spaced Repetition](/learning/spaced-repetition) and [Incremental Reading](/learning/incremental-reading). These methods were pioneered by Dr. [Piotr Wozniak](/supermemo/piotr-wozniak)[^1], creator of SuperMemo. They enable users to form long-lasting memories, and to gain new knowledge more efficiently compared with Traditional techniques.

While the success of SuperMemo is often attributed to its novel techniques and advanced algorithms, Dr. Piotr Wozniak and many <abbr title="Users who have been using SuperMemo for a duration ranging from a few years, up to several decades.">long-time users</abbr> of SuperMemo[^2] emphasize the importance of [Pleasure of Learning](/learning/pleasure-of-learning) in all forms of learning activities.
