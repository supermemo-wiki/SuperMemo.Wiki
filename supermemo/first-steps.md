[^1]: SM-17 was a [significant leap](https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Is_Algorithm_SM-17_much_better_than_Algorithm_SM-15%3F) in the algorithm predictive efficiency. [SM-18](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-18) introduced the stabilization curve.
[^2]: Based on SM-2, see [FAQ](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm.html). For a comparison see [Universal metric](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Universal_metric_for_cross-comparison_of_spaced_repetition_algorithms#Algorithmic_contest:_SuperMemo_2_vs._SuperMemo_17).
