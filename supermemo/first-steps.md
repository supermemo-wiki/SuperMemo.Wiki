## Mac and Linux

**SuperMemo** is a windows application, but these are some options that let you run it on other Operating systems:

### Mac

- [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/) (Mac): 40$/year with [student discount](https://www.parallels.com/landingpage/pd/education/) but has best user experience (has 14 day free trial) 
- [VMWare Fusion](https://www.vmware.com/in/products/fusion.html): around 100$ for an[ academic license](https://store-us.vmware.com/vmware-in-education) but worse performance than parallels (has 30 day free trial) 
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/): free and open source but worst performing option of the three

### Linux

- [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/in/products/workstation-player/workstation-player-evaluation.html): commercial with a free tier for Linux 
- [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/): free and open source, but poorer performance 
- [Wine](https://github.com/alessivs/supermemo-wine): a user got SuperMemo mostly working on wine but there are various caveats and you will not be able to use[ SuperMemo Assistant](https://supermemo.wiki/sma/)
