[^100]: SM-17 was a [significant leap](https://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Is_Algorithm_SM-17_much_better_than_Algorithm_SM-15%3F) in the algorithm predictive efficiency. [SM-18](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Algorithm_SM-18) introduced the stabilization curve.
[^101]: Based on SM-2, see [FAQ](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/what-spaced-repetition-algorithm.html). For a comparison with SM-18 see [Universal metric](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Universal_metric_for_cross-comparison_of_spaced_repetition_algorithms#Algorithmic_contest:_SuperMemo_2_vs._SuperMemo_17).
[^102]: Partial implementation with the Incremental Reading [add-on](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/935264945).
[^103]: SuperMemo 15 through 18 has partial [support for Linux](http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/SuperMemo_for_Linux). Plugins do not work in Linux.
[^104]: SM 17+ has Plugins through [SMA](https://sma.supermemo.wiki/). Anki has a rich add-on [ecosystem](https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/).
[^105]: With the [PDF plugin](https://github.com/supermemo/SuperMemoAssistant.Plugins.PDF/).
[^106]: With the [SIAC addon](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1781298089).
[^107]: Anki decks [can be converted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j6dmQHMGTJs) to SuperMemo.
[^108]: Using PDF, IR and other Anki addons significantly increases the complexity.
