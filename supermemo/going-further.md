# Incremental Reading Manual


Using incremental reading to go through the [Incremental reading manual](https://help.supermemo.org/index.php?title=Incremental_learning) is one of the best ways to attain deep proficiency in SuperMemo. You can follow the instructions [here](https://supermemo.guru/wiki/Incremental_reading_step_by_step#Big_test) under "big test" for how to do so. Note, there have been recent issues with references when importing. We plan to provide soon a pre-edited version.
