## Incremental learning with IR

Using incremental reading to go through the **incremental learning guide** is one of the best ways to quickly gain in proficiency with SuperMemo and learning techniques.

### Recommended approach

The **official recommendations**[^1] for processing the incremental learning guide is to splinter the entire manual into 340 daily tips:

1. Open the [incremental learning](https://help.supermemo.org/index.php?title=Incremental_learning) page in Internet Explorer
2. In SuperMemo, import the article with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>
3. In SuperMemo, open the *Commander* with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>
4. Type `sp` to highlight the **Split article** option, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

Your current speed of learning and level of proficiency are largely irrelevant. If you **process one per day**, you will be **done in a year**.

If you get **1% better each day**, in comparison with today, you will be **37.78 times** better in one year.

> The secret to good life is **constant, incremental progress**.

You can speed up the processing of important facts even further by postponing low-priority articles to later dates or by reducing their priority with <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>.
