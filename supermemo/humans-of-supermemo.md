# What is Humans of SuperMemo ?

This page contains the **personal stories** and **interviews** of SuperMemo users.

It is born from the idea that understanding the benefits of learning from an intellectual perspective doesn't automatically translate into an affective state that predicates the actual act of learning.

This initiative attempts to support the theoretical framework found on this wiki with **stories that are relatable to** us as **sentient creatures**.

## User stories

### Naess

I found SuperMemo on my search for optimal learning methods. Passing the entrance exam for my university was the main motivator behind increasing productivity in learning.

Before SM I used Anki for 6 months. As someone who was obsessed with ‘optimality’, SM’s superior algorithm over Anki was the selling point for me.

Shortly after starting to use SM, I found Piotr’s writings about the pleasure of learning. I didn’t think much of it at first, but over time it all started to make sense: pleasurable learning is the optimal, tools and algorithms are secondary.

Whereas in the past it was all about exams and grades, these days it is about inherently enjoying the study material and nothing can beat that! It creates a force that pulls you to study the material without having to resort to discipline or external rewards and that is optimal.

I always had a strong learn drive that luckily survived the school system. I knew the existence of SuperMemo when I installed Anki back in 2008, as Anki was based on SuperMemo. I read about it, but I never gave SuperMemo a try as it was not open source.

After growing my collection during a decade and suffering from Anki limitations, I finally decided to give SuperMemo a try because of Incremental Reading. I was having a very strong cognitive dissonance about Wozniak’s writings and SuperMemo being proprietary software.

My initial thought was to document my transition to SuperMemo, recording my whole experience as not every day you see a user with ten years of intense use of SRS being brand new to SuperMemo. One of my initial surprises was the community, which has been very engaging and good-hearted, as well as contributing high quality insights about learning and related topics.

After using SuperMemo for about 4 months, I realized that SuperMemo is not a replacement for Anki, or vice versa. There is not a SM versus Anki. Most of what I do in SuperMemo I cannot do it on Anki. I am developing new habits of incrementalism in reading, writing, video and email, and this is a gamer changer, especially Incremental Reading.

I have been watching anime for a long time. I wanted to learn japanese. I took japanese class at college. I memorized words and the alphabet by writing and repeating a lot.

After I graduated I wanted to develop my language skills even further. I found anki to memorize words and kanji. I used it 1,5 years. It worked pretty well at the start then repetitions piled up.

I have found supermemo before but I thought it was complicated so I didn’t use it for like 6 months. Then I decided to give supermemo a chance. It was the best decision. At first it was hard but I got used to it. Now I read and learn about lots of different subjects. With supermemo I discovered the joy of learning.
