# What is Humans of SuperMemo ?

This page contains the **personal stories** and **interviews** of SuperMemo users.

It is born from the idea that understanding the benefits of learning from an intellectual perspective doesn't automatically translate into the affective state that predicates the actual act of learning.

This initiative attempts to support the theoretical framework found on this wiki with **stories that are relatable to us**.
