# What's this?
This is an online version of the [SuperMemo Lore PDF](https://github.com/supermemo/SuperMemoLore).

# Using SuperMemo
## Introduction
SuperMemo is easy if:
* you start from a 5 min. face-to-face intro from a friend, or
* you start from reading [ABC of SuperMemo](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Introduction) and stick to the guidelines (or venture further along [this schedule](http://help.supermemo.org/wiki/Step-by-step_to_SuperMemo_mastery)), and
* you stick to the **Beginner level** for as long as it takes to understand the power of SuperMemo (which should be enough to make you persist with further explorations).

SuperMemo is difficult if:
* you start from trying to understand it by reading the documentation (e.g. about [Incremental reading](http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Incremental_reading), [Priority queue](http://supermemopedia.com/wiki/Priority_queue), etc.)
* you venture to the **Professional level** and try to understand SuperMemo by just "trying it out"
* you are a software expert who believes that knowing 100 other applications will help you sail with SuperMemo
* you try to use SuperMemo for purposes that it is not suitable for. For example:
  * cramming
  * presentations
  * teaching
  * database
  * knowledge organizer
* you struggle with one of SuperMemo's many weaknesses:
* non-English keyboards
* imports from browsers other than Internet Explorer
* import and export of data to and from other applications
* departure from standards of time, units, formatting, etc.
* you aren't able to estimate the total amount of time required to extract, transform, and memorize your collection
* you bite off more than you can chew
