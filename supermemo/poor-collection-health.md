# Symptoms

- Boredom
- Absence of concrete projects

# How to select material ?

Just trying to stay grounded in the utility of information
I'm interested in so many things and I feel a strong pull to learn everything, but I can't. There's just so little time in life
So I'm trying to focus more on stuff that's useful now instead of potentially useful in the future, or just interesting.
Could talk about bad items, not following your learn drive, not having enough applicable material, not importing frequently enough, etc

# How to deal with an unhealthy collection ?

## Starting from scratch

## Incremental re-prioritization

1) Massively deprioritize whole branches
2) Start prioritizing with your new heuristics
3) Import new knowledge you're really into
4) Whenever something you deprioritized comes up and it's important, look in the KT and navigate up the ancestor line until you've reached a node that not so interesting anymore
5) Reprioritize the last interesting node
